Ello there,

Welcome to my sprouting GitHub page. There may not be that much to look at right now, but don't worry.
I'm always looking to learn more and experiment with code. The reason I started coding is to share dazzling
visual narratives like my favorite games (Horizon Zero Dawn/Forbidden West) and bring together communities that
share the joy of heartfelt stories.

So, what am I up to?

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a business (to be updated)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CS, Japanese, and rock climbing
- ðŸ“¢ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on practical problems that help people now
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nevahl189@gmail.com (personal), brown.muindi@gmail.com (business)
- âš¡ Fun fact: My bookshelf grows faster than I can read through (if you have any recommendations *Fiction/Finance* i'd love to add them)
