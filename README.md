Ello there,

You don't know this but a constant ⚔️ is waged inside yourself❗
What keeps you unaware, steals opportunities from right under your 👃.
Are you aiming to steer your life or watch the 🗺️ pass you by?
Start thinking for yourself, and grasp an advantage unavailable to most.
Life is a question. Its answer, how you choose to live yours. 

So, what am I up to?

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing a business (to be updated)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS (you knew that), Japanese (makes sense), and rock climbing
- 📢 I’m looking to collaborate on practical problems that help people now
- 📫 How to reach me: nevahl189@gmail.com (personal), brown.muindi@gmail.com (business)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My bookshelf grows faster than I can read through (if you have any recommendations *Fiction/Finance* i'd love to add them)
