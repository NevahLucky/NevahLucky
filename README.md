Ello there,

You don't know this but you're in a constant ⚔️ of attrition. One waged against the 🗺️ and yourself❗
What keeps you unaware steals opportunities from right under your 👃.
Start 🤔 for yourself, and you'll have an advantage unlike any other.
Life is a question. Its answer, how you choose to live yours.

So, what am I up to?

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing a business (to be updated)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS (you knew that), Japanese (makes sense), and rock climbing
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on practical problems that help people now
- 📫 How to reach me: nevahl189@gmail.com (personal), brown.muindi@gmail.com (business)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My bookshelf grows faster than I can read through (if you have any recommendations *Fiction/Finance* i'd love to add them)
